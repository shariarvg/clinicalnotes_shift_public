# **Clinical Notes Shift**

This repository contains my work on analyzing clinical notes. Most of the analysis is performed in Jupyter notebooks (located in the `notebooks` folder), although some notebooks depend on data generated by Python scripts executed using bash files. 

Documentation is currently a work in progress, as I just uploaded everything to GitHub. Below are some notable files and their functions.

## **Notable Files**

### Python Tools
- **`pythontools/mmd_tools.py`**
  - Contains methods for embedding documents with a large language model.
    - Word-to-document embedding is achieved through averaging across words.
  - Includes implementations for performing MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancy) calculations.
  - Provides methods for various permutation tests, including tests under the null assumption.

- **`pythontools/mimic_tools.py`**
  - Defines the `MIMICEndpoint` class, which:
    - Downloads clinical notes.
    - Merges notes with admissions and patient data to estimate admission times.
    - Provides access to notes from a specific diagnosis using the `get_notes_diagnosis` method.

- **`pythontools/mimic_source.py`**
  - A class wrapper for certain methods in `mimic_tools`.
  - Allows for conceptualizing different "sources" of data, such as:
    - Notes from hospital admissions with a single diagnosis (`get_notes_K_diagnosis` method).
    - Notes from specific diagnosis codes like `I10` or `Z515` (`get_notes_diagnosis` method).
    - Notes from a mixture of diagnoses (`get_notes_mixture` method).

## **Structure**

- **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for analysis.
- **`pythonscripts/`**: Includes Python scripts for data preprocessing and analysis.
- **`bashfiles/`**: Bash scripts used for running Python scripts and organizing workflows.

## **To-Do**
- Improve documentation for easier navigation.
- Add detailed examples and workflows for new users.
